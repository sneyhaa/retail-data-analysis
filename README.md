- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `queries/`: SQL queries for analyzing different aspects of customer demographics.
- `results/screenshots/`: Screenshots of the query results.

## Data
The dataset used for this analysis is `customer_data.csv`, originally sourced from Kaggle but it was cleaned, preprocessed using Python to fit the needs of the analysis process.

## Queries
